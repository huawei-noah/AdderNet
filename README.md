# AdderNet: Do We Really Need Multiplications in Deep Learning?
This code is a demo of CVPR 2020 paper [AdderNet: Do We Really Need Multiplications in Deep Learning?](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Chen_AdderNet_Do_We_Really_Need_Multiplications_in_Deep_Learning_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf) 

We present adder networks (AdderNets) to trade massive multiplications in deep neural networks, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for much cheaper additions to reduce computation costs. In AdderNets, we take the L1-norm distance between filters and input feature as the output response. As a result, the proposed AdderNets can achieve 74.9% Top-1 accuracy 91.7% Top-5 accuracy using ResNet-50 on the ImageNet dataset without any multiplication in convolution layer.

## Requirements

- python 3
- pytorch >= 1.1.0
- torchvision

### Preparation
You can follow [pytorch/examples](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/imagenet) to prepare the ImageNet data.

The pretrained models are available in [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11ZdIst5Vwqx9Y5zHhirfaI94_7RhcBZH?usp=sharing) or [baidu cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pkaWhhKVoWPv-MCUjvxzCw) (access code:126b)

### Usage
Run `python main.py` to train on CIFAR-10. 

Run `python test.py --data_dir 'path/to/imagenet_root/'` to evaluate on ImageNet `val` set. You will achieve 74.9% Top accuracy and 91.7% Top-5 accuracy on the ImageNet dataset using ResNet-50.

Run `python test.py --dataset cifar10 --model_dir models/ResNet20-AdderNet.pth --data_dir 'path/to/cifar10_root/'` to evaluate on CIFAR-10. You will achieve 91.8% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset using ResNet-20.

The inference and training of AdderNets is slow since the adder filters is implemented without cuda acceleration. You can write [cuda](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-samples/index.html) to achieve higher inference speed.
